# TextEditor

A file editor is an application that allows users to open, edit, and save files in the format of text files (.txt). The user can open a file using the "Open" menu item and select the desired file using the file chooser dialog. The content of the file will then be loaded into a text area where the user can view and edit the text.

The user can change the font, size, and color of the text.

Files can be saved using the "Save" menu item. A file chooser dialog will appear where the user can specify the name and location to save the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

Additionally, the editor can filter files to only display those with the ".txt" extension and allows only files with this extension to be opened.

Overall, the file editor provides a convenient way to edit text files and provides some options for customizing the display of the text.
